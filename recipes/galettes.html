   <h1>Galettes</h1> 
   <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2PpTZHJOALs/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Galette with egg and ham">
   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>This buckwheat crepe is the savory cousin of the sweet crepe that many Americans
    are familiar with. A favorite in rainy Bretagne, the galette's unique nutty flavor
    comes from buckwheat flour. While you are free to choose any topping of your liking.
    the classic - and best, in our opinion - preparation is with ham, gruyere cheese, and
    a sunny side up egg on top. Best enjoyed with some hard cider.</p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <h3>Galette Batter</h3>
   <ul>
        <li>2 cups buckwheat flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
        <li>4 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Additional Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Ham</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Gruyere cheese, grated</li>
    </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
        <li>To make the batter: Mix the ingredients together until
            well-combined. Let the batter sit in the frige for 2 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Heat an 11 inch cast-iron crepe griddle pan on medium heat until
            evenly hot. The pan should be hot enough to immediatley punch holes
            through the batter when poured.</li>
        <li>Melt enough butter to coat the whole pan. Pour 1/2 cup of batter
            and tilt the pan to cover its whole surface.</li>
        <li>Cook approximately 2 1/2 minutes on first side, then flip and cook for another
            1 1/2 minutes. Remove the galette from the heat and let cool. Repeat with all
            of the batter, adding butter to the pan as needed to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Adding toppings: Melt butter and toss in a cooled galette. Put a slice of ham
            in the middle, followed by grated gruyere. Meanwhile, in a separate skillet, 
            cook an egg in melted butter. When the egg is nearly cooked, gently place
            it over the gruyer with the yolk centered and fold over the four edges of the
            galette to leave only the egg visible.</li>
        <li>Cover with a lid and heat for a minute or so until the egg is cooked
            and the bottom of the galette is crisp. Serve immediately.</li>  
   </ol>
